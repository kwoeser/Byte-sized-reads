## Management Plan
Ideal Roles:
- Hazel: Backend
- Alen: Backend Database
- An: Front-End
- Karma: Front-End
- Jason: Front-end and Docker Implementation
- Sam: Web Scraper

Meeting Time: Mondays after class (3:20-4:00pm)

Meetings will include checking back on the milestone plan to see if roles need to be adjusted or if timeline needs to be moved. We will keep track of tasks and progress via github management tools.

Implementation Plan:
- Step 1: Research/ Reimplementation of previous tools
- Step 2: Development of Administrative Tools, Back-End, and Front-End
- Step 3: Test Deployment for Website
- Step 4: Fix Bugs/ Make Improvements
- Step 5: Create Presentation
- Step 6: Documentation (done throughout project)

Intermediate Prototype is a website with a basic search engine for one kind of topic that produces article results to the user. We have chosen these steps so that we can implement each part of the website simultaneously for integration. Some risks with this implementation include unspecified role management, attempting to add too many features, and security issues with the login implementation. We can reduce these risks by making sure we communicate clearly and create proper documentation of individual work and data storage.
