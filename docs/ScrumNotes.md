# Scrum MM/DD/YYYY

Attendees: X, Y, Z

Typical agenda (each person takes a turn):
* Progress updates (what was done since last meeting). Use GitHub Project Board to refer to specific tasks being worked on. If you are working on a task that is not on the board, add it to the board.
* Blockers (what is preventing progress)

Group discussion:
* Action items (what needs to be done before next meeting)
* Other topics (key decisions, planning, etc.)
